     * criteria you specify when you store the certificate. To view or manage your certificates directly, please
     * log onto the administrative website for the product you purchased.
     *  
     * Using exemption certificates endpoints requires setup of an auditable document storage for each company that will use certificates.
     * Companies that do not have this storage system set up will receive the error `CertCaptureNotConfiguredError` when they call exemption
     * certificate related APIs. To check if this company is set up, call `GetCertificateSetup`. To request setup of the auditable document

     * never return a error. It provides basic information about the server you connect to:
     *  
     * * `version` - The version number of the AvaTax API server that responded to your request. The AvaTax API version number is updated once per month during Avalara's update process.
     * * `authenticated` - A boolean flag indicating whether or not you sent valid credentials with your API request.
     * * `authenticationType` - If you provided valid credentials to the API, this field will tell you whether you used Bearer, Username, or LicenseKey authentication.
     * * `authenticatedUserName` - If you provided valid credentials to the API, this field will tell you the username of the currently logged in user.
     * * `authenticatedUserId` - If you provided valid credentials to the API, this field will tell you the user ID of the currently logged in user.
     * * `authenticatedAccountId` - If you provided valid credentials to the API, this field will contain the account ID of the currently logged in user.
     *  
     * This API helps diagnose connectivity problems between your application and AvaTax; you may call this API even
     * if you do not have verified connection credentials. If this API fails, either your computer is not connected to
     * the internet, or there is a routing problem between your office and Avalara, or the Avalara server is not available.
